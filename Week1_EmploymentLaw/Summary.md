# Summarize this Weeks Material

## What challenges arise from employee laws

Employee laws are complex with different sections applying to the organization depending on characteristics. For example a group of less than 5 does not need to worry as much about diversity as a company of 500; though that does not mean they can ignore it outright.

To address these challenges the organization needs to have:

1. Principals which demand fairness and equality
2. Defined policies for each area of the employee life cycle (hire, train, promote, terminate)
3. Legal or other expert review of the policies

If the business starts with broad principals that everyone will be treated fairly and judged on their skill and results delivered; then it will not solve all the problems but at least the management can herd the employees in the right direction.

Once they are going the right path control functions need to exist similar to any other area of management. Are we hiring/promoting/terminating in a fair and balanced manner? Do we react to discrimination or harassment claims promptly? etc.

Finally these plans, policies, and other control functions need to be reviewed by an area expert. Having someone with proper legal or related training ensures that the plan meets all requirements.

If requirements are missed then the manager or even the corporation can be liable. Through legal proceedings the business can be forced to pay huge settlements. The text quoted that the median settlement for age discrimination was 300k$

Even worst than paying these restitutions the companies public image could become tainted. Consider the fall out if the CEO was charged in a large sexual harassment case. This would cause some groups to boycott the companies products, head lines would shun the company, and downplay the hard work of the rest of the company.

## What are the key take aways from the material

This week started by describing the purpose of human resource management, and how it is a critical component to organization success. An area that I found particularly interesting was: modular business as a mechanism for globalization.

As a future business owner I like the idea of having a company that outsources large parts of the work, and acts as an integrator. Having a business that is structured in such a manner reduces fixed costs and ensures that investments are being made to only the core deliverables. However these reduced fixed causes mandates that human resources and human resource information systems (HRIS) are effectively utilized.

Then we moved on to focusing on the reduction of union work and the increase of "at will employment." This will be very important to my future business as it keeps the company in control of the company. Though with great power comes great responsibility, and we still need to be cautious about keeping the employees happy and giving them a fair deal.

To ensure that people are getting a fair deal, we need to understand the rules of the game. These rules are defined by several federal acts and policies, which asks us to reward or punish employees based on their results. It is not only unethical but illegal to short change someone due to being too old or young, too black or too white.

The text concluded by describing the way termination and punished should be handled. It asks us to be fair and well documented in our approach, this will help reduce lawsuits and make sure we are terminating the person for the right reasons.

# Internal Politics within Organization

For a long time I wondered why others received promotions faster than me, despite my work being better. Now looking back at my experience across small, mid, and corporate environments; the "who you know" was always my underperformed component to success.

The truth is that business decisions are driven by internal politics. This raises the question what drives the politics? The answer is high visibility ideas, which leads to the follow up questions: what makes an idea high visibility?

The visibility is achieved through network and seeking out the stakeholders in the business processes. If we neglect this portion of our career, then at best we will only be as good as our manager's influence divided by their attention.

Even if the manager is highly influential, what happens when they leave the group? At that point our political capital takes a hit, how much depends on the person being a single point of failure or just one of many avenues of communication.

That is not to say that businesses should act unethical in their selection, or good work go unrecognized. However it is the natural tenancy especially as the signal to noise ratio decreases (e.g. size of the group increases).  

Nor am I promoting "dirty politics" which is a completely different game, that good human resource policies should ban. These only reduce the visibility of good ideas and hurt the organization.

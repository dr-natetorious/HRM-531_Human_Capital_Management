# Themes of Employment Laws

## How does minimum wage impact business

There is currently a large debate on raising the minimum wage to 15$ across the board in the city of Seattle. The argument on one side is that it would improve the economy by putting more money into the lower class. Meanwhile the other side is concerned that the increase of 35% will hurt small businesses.

If I were to start a business in Seattle, there would be an ethical decision of continue plans to start in Seattle; or open a few miles outside the boarder and reduce the additional cost.

How I would approach the problem is first consider what that 35% increase in labor is really costing me. If the positions are easier to fill with more qualified employees, that might be worth it; especially in a high turnover industry.

If that extra 5$ per employee/hour cuts to much into profits, then we need to balance employee moral against number of people during a shift. Perhaps instead of having 4 people @ 10$ the schedule needs to be written as 3 people @ 15$; and no more overtime.

## Should businesses use internal or extern auditing

An organization needs to both internal and external audits, and run them at different cadences. For example internal audits might be performed every quarter and external audits every end of fiscal year.

Having internal audits provides reduces costs and increases awareness of any issues. The teams that own the work feel more accountable and will also have more context to toward discovered issues.

Meanwhile the external audits make sure that the internal audits are running smoothly and efficiently. If they continuously find numerous compliance issues, then it acts as trigger to signal more training is needed.

## How do we scale awareness of employment laws

My employer has nearly 200,000 employees working in every major city across the globe. At this scale nearly every global or local employment law is a lawsuit waiting to happen.

How we approach the problem is having a company wide "business conduct training" every 6 months and mandating that it is completed by every employee. Doesn't matter if the person is a part time worker in the loading dock or the CEO everyone takes it, period.

During 4 hour video series presents a series of scenarios and then asks the video what was wrong and needed to be handled differently. It covers discrimination, nepotism, ethical challenges, harassment, and other core values of the business.

This protects the business in legal matters, as they can say "on 9/5 nateb completed the sexual harassment training and signed off that he knew what was wrong."

In addition to the training each team has a legal, hr, compliance, and now privacy buddies; all tasked with addressing any issues. Knowing that these experts are available further reduces problems as we can get confirmation/approval before making the decision final.

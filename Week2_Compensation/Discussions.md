# Themes in Compensation

## What impact does demographics have on compensation

When a business wants to buy talent and skills resources, then need they need to find employees that willing to sell those resources. This creates a standard economic pattern of supply and demand.

If we then look at the number of people in India or Nigeria, that are willing to work for 8800$/year; there is a large supply so in a fair market system we would expect to have to pay them less.

Comparatively in America most professionals ask that per month, making the supply fairly low. With a low supply the business will have to select less qualified employees to meet the price point.

If we are to make a competitive compensation, then the first step is to understand the conditions of this fair market system. This can be obtained through sites such as payscale.com which publish statistics and general scales of magnitude.

There are other dimensions to the problem such as how much stability the business needs. If it takes 12 months to train a new employee, then they are effectively saying we need a more specific employee which there is an even further limited supply of.

## Should benefits packages be customizable

Most companies take a 'one-size fits all' approach to benefits packages, which results in waste for some and insufficiencies for others. To address these challenges my company lets the employees pick their package, update-able once per year in November via a self-service web portal.

For example when I was 21, my health costs were minimal so selecting an HSA with 1750 deposited each year was ideal. Now that I'm married with children on the way I'll update it to be unlimited coverage with zero copay.

There are lots of other knobs such as how much life insurance we want. If we choose not to have any, then they give us an extra 22$ per pay period since we reduced their costs. Similarly we can choose to be over insured and they will take some take some small amount out of our base pay to cover the cost.

This makes it very easy to communicate the value of benefits as everything in it is actually useful to me. The parts I didn't want e.g. the gym membership, I sold/ opted for more base pay.

### When does customizable packages not work

I was thinking about different organizations that the "cafeteria model" does or does not work well for.

In general it seems that the smaller the business the less efficient the model would be. This comes from the increased costs of additional human resources and the inability to get volume discounts through the different programs.

There could also be additional difficulties for small and mid sized businesses supporting the data collection and entry for all of the variants.

This could be addressed through HRIS software, but the licensing costs could be too high for small businesses. Medium and large sized businesses with multiple branches run the risk of fragmentation and competing software standards. These redundancies can lead to big overhead fees as the results are merged together at headquarters.

Larger businesses will likely have a dedicated IT department and can dilute these costs among their preplanned budget. Also they are likely to have larger human resource departments which also allows those costs to be diluted across more staff.

## Should compensation be transparently discussed

I worked at the local theater with a bunch of other 16 to 20 years, all making the same pay more or less. Then one day a supervisor accidentally posted the manager's schedule view instead of the employee's schedule view in the break room.

The difference was that the manager's view had an additional cost per hour column for calculating labor costs. This caused a huge stir among the employees as everyone debated why that person gets 5 cents an hour more than me! Watching teenagers argue about nickels seems petty but the same behavior exists even into the professional world.

Recently I was in my boss's office and he had the pay from one of my peers on his screen. It was temporarily demoralizing as I've been there longer, work more hours, and on higher visibility work; but he gets 15% more than me.

From the childish perspective I want to switch groups and say that's not fair. Though its a just a number and doesn't have any context, such as does he have extra health benefits due to having 3 children? Hard to say without awkwardly confronting the peer.

Ultimately should it matter? No, does it yes.

## Should company's buy their employees receive long term disability benefits

Everyone should have long term disability insurance, its really cheap and if you get the chance to use then you'll get up to 60% pay for up to the remainder of your career. Assuming 20% of the people do collect, its slightly more expensive than a state lottery ticket and approximately 10000% more likely to pay out.

Though we should be cautious about that 1:5 ratio as it can be miss leading. Of the entire population 1:5 do collect, however that population includes both blue and white collar positions. Between the two groups, its much more probable that the physical intensive employee will be injured compared to the office employee.

There are other factors here such as preexisting medical conditions, extracurricular activities, locality, etc. However of the population subset with advanced degrees who work in an office situation that we fit into is below the 1:5 ratio.

Comparatively for our subset we are more likely to need short term disability insurance, as our injuries will statistically be a broken leg or an illness.

## How does outsourcing influence compensation

As a future business owner making competitive decisions about compensation will be critical to retaining talent. These compensation packages will typically have both a small fixed amount plus a variable gratuity for additional performance.

This is great for human resources which we are highly specialized and also are required continuously by the business. However what highly specialized resources which are needed either periodically or infrequently? For those scenario it is likely more cost efficient to out source the labor.

Given that the world is moving away from a production centric, to more of a service centric; it seems that will become more of the norm. In such a world our compensation packages will need to be based more on pay per job or per billable hour.

The contracted employee or company will then have a contractual obligation to meet a predefined service level agreement (SLA); at that point there is not really a concept for additional pay for performance. Instead additional performance will translate to more likely the contract becomes renewed.

From the service providers perspective they will need to sort benefits and compensation packages for their employees. If they cannot then their ability to meet their SLA will minimalized. Once the SLA cannot be obtained it's a progressive path starting at: apologies, to credits, to refunds, and ending at lawsuit settlements.

Depending on our business model it seems that we will have at least one side of this challenge, perhaps at times both.

## How can you incentivize employees without using money

As an employee I don't want more money I _want more free things_.

For example my company just completed its fiscal year and gave out merit increases for a job well done. The conversation centered around this 6% increase and they were appreciative of my work.

After tax that works out to approximately 8$/day; which is difficult to get excited about as this has no impact on my standard of life. Don't get me wrong I gladly took it, but where is the long term morale increase?

Looking back across the year my partner team bought me a 6 pack of beer (8$) another bought me a bottle of nice wine (15$). Another team gave me a 50$ voucher at a nice local restaurant. Those were a fraction the cost, stand out far more in my mind, and resulted in me going further out of my way to assist them on later issues.

Instead of giving me 8$/day, I'd rather have more responsibility, visibility, or acknowledgment of effort; which are free. Though I could be alone in this perspective.

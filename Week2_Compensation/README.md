Subject: Welcome!

Welcome!

It is with great pleasure that I welcome you to our team. Atwood and Allen consulting is one of the leaders in business development and innovation and we are successful because of our team. It is with your help that we will continue to be a leader in our field, and I am excited to work with you.

Over the next several weeks, you will be given various tasks that you must complete for our clients. I have assigned you to three particular clients. Each of these clients is in a unique situation and, to give you a variety to work with, I have chosen a small-, medium-, and large-sized business. All of the businesses you will be working with are venturing into new territory and they need help with their HR policies and procedures.

I will be in communication with each of these clients and I will save my communications with them for you to use as a reference. Most, if not all, of the information you need to complete the tasks should be available in the communications, so make sure you check them carefully for any relevant and useful information.

Each week, you will be required to work with only one of the clients, although you may choose which client to work with. In the following weeks, you can either continue to work with the same client, or you can choose to work with the other clients. In some instances, however, you will need to work with a group to complete the task. Your team, however, will still have the freedom to choose which client to work with. I want you to have the freedom to work with the size and type of business that interests you, but I also want you to have the opportunity to be challenged by working with business sizes or types that may be more unfamiliar to you.

The choice is yours. No matter what, though, you're going to gain some valuable experience and I'm happy you're a part of our team. Now, let's get to work!

Sincerely,

Traci Goldeman
Manager
Atwood and Allen Consulting

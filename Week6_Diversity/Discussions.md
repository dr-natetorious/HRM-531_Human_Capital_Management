# Discussions on Diversity

## What is the value-add of diversity in team work

Having a diverse work environment leads to more scenarios being considered resulting in better results. Outside of the academic benefits organizations which are heavily diverse and more likely to please a wider audience of customers. This in turn leads larger and more frequent revenue opportunities. 

Given the benefits it is important for managers to create diverse work groups. This can be challenging for some positions as it requires advertising the job in new places which might not be as familiar to the manager.

For example a common recruiting method is to ask members of the current team to recommend their friends. If the existing team is all white males in their 30s, then it is likely that this method will return more white males in their 30s. To mitigate this the management needs to advertise to womens, Asian, etc. professional groups.  

Afterward the group needs to be sustainable, which requires mutual respect and conflict resolution. Consider an extreme scenario of Archie Bunker (famous television racist) being given a team of minorities. Since he would not value their opinion they would be frustrated and quit after a short period of time.

## Are there any downsides to diversity

The double edged sword comes of diversity comes with the variety of different ideas. Having different view points can enable more ideas to be explored and better more complete results to delivered.  

However having more view points also means that there are more considerations that need to be filtered out. For example if the purpose of a working group is to come up with a solution that works for a local market, having an understanding of best practices for a different market may not be useful.

Another challenge with different view points is that it will lead to conflict. This needs to be addressed by calmly and rationally looking at the evidence associated with each view point. Then determine if it is credible and relevant to the discussion. If it is then the ideas need to be incorporated into the solution.

### How can you reduce these challenges

A common reason that people dislike diversity is that it is unfamiliar, and therefore intimidating. To eliminate some of these misjudgments the leadership team can have team building activities. These do not need to be limited to moral events, they can also be forcing people to work together that typically wouldn't.

As the people spend more time together, the other parties customs and behaviors will become "more normal" through understanding and acceptance. Once this initial hurdle has been overcome then it becomes easier to break down the barriers and gain value from diversity.

## Do businesses need to overcome sociological challenges

There are many sociological challenges which need to also be overcome. For example it is still considered bad form if a woman neglects her family to focus more a career. This is due to hundreds of years of gender roles, which only started to change during the woman's lib movement of the 1960s.

Similarly different minorities were segregated into the 40s and 50s. This reduced the opportunities which were available to current generations grand parents and great grand parents, which in term limited their parents ability to seek education and management positions. In comparison there were lots of white families with education and leadership positions, which enabled them to mentor and their children into following similar career paths.

There have been efforts to improve the situation such as affirmitive action, which has helped even the playing field. However, it will still take a few more generations until we reach full equality. To ensure we reach that point as quickly as possible diversity education needs to be taught to future leader.

## Can a business go overboard on diversity

There are two ends to the scale discrimination and reverse discrimination. We need to be careful to find a balanced position between these two extremes, resulting in a qualified and diversified work force.

With reverse discrimination the company is lowering standards and allowing unqualified or under qualified staff join the team. This causes additional overhead on the existing team members as they need to both do their previous job and also double check the new members work. These inefficiencies can then lead to the employee costing more than they produce.

At the other end a company should not raise their standards to unqualified a candidate, because they are `<blah>`. The standards should be consistent and align with the business needs. They cannot be `<X>` requirements for group 1 of people and `<Y>` for another, as that is a sign of poor leadership and inability to determine what those business needs are.

## Should businesses have a right to discriminate

Excluding team members, customers, potential candidates because they are `<blah>`; is an illogical decision which undermines core business principals.

For example the news has been full of recent stories of store owners refusing service for gay marriages. This does not make sense as they are not violating any laws and their money spends as well as the anyone else. Refusing service to `<blah>` reduces potential revenue and hinders the growth of the organization.

Next there are potential candidates for open positions, which are qualified but are also `<blah>`. Refusing these people also does not make sense as leaving the position vacant lowers moral (e.g. overworked staff) and decreases potential revenue. Instead concerning ourselves with who they choose to sleep with, we need to focus on the relevant facts. Can they do the job? Are they likely to quit on us? Will they be an asset to the team?

Lastly are team members who are hired, but excluded due to being `<blah>`. They have already been weeded out as being qualified and are even on the payroll. It doesn't make sense to pay for something and not use it, which is effectively the same thing.

## Who sets the tone for the culture in your organization and does it allow free expression

The tone is set by the leadership, as they have the authority to permit or deny any behavior which they do not care for. For example if a team member is bossy and decreasing team productivity, it is the responsibility of the manager to step up and change this.

My company makes a bulk of their money through selling ideas that are implemented as software. It would not make sense for them to discourage expression as this would decrease the number of ideas at their disposal, thus reducing potential revenue.

In my immediate team a lot of the public facing tone is set by my boss and myself. This is because we are extroverts and the other members are introverts. Though they complement our skills with different skills such as having more due diligence and providing different views.

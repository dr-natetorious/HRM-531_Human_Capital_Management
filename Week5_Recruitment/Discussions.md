# Themes in Recruitment and Selection Strategies

## Can you staff a business solely on recommendations

In the ideal scenario we can staff based on recommendations of our existing employees. Using recommendations reduces the costs finding new staff and the existing employees will be happier working as its time spent with other people they like.

However the staff might recommend their friends even though they are under qualified. This can be offset by letting the recommender know that their credibility is associated with the decision. If the employee is career bound this will discourage them from making poor recommendations. Though a employee that sees the position as "just a job" might not care or be willing to sell there credibility for the referral bonus.

Another challenge is that people are often publicly praised and privately shamed. The recommender might not be aware of behavioral issues of the recommended person, and despite best intentions it results in a poor fit.

Another challenge is that this works once the staff has been established and needs to grow. During the initial selection process it can be more difficult to get good candidates from this approach as the number of options will be small.

## Business Strategy and Organizational Culture

No matter how good of business strategy can be created, it will never work without the talent needed to deliver it. Because of this it is critical that the right staff are selected from the potential candidates.

The right staff needs to align on technical qualifications in addition to soft skills on par with the organizational culture. Consider an extreme scenario of being a cashier at Hot Topic clothing. The organization has a particular style that staff members will either love or hate. Then compare this to being a cashier at Target. 

If the team member dislikes the culture, there needs to be effort to make them feel comfortable. However at the end of the day, if the person does not want to work there; they are likely to under perform, costing the business time and money.

## Combining Recruiting and Outsourcing

Recruiting is a lot like dating, first you wine and dine the potential candidate and hope they will over look your weaknesses and sign on. Afterward they hopefully didn't lie on their resume and will perform at the expected level. Assuming they do perform as expected then there is no guarantee they will continue working there for a long period of time afterward.

Alternatively businesses can rely more heavily on outsourcing to other organizations. Then a contract can be signed and a service level agreement purchased for a defined length of time. The other business is then responsible for holding up their legal obligation or compensating their customer if they fail to deliver.

The outsourcing model seems significantly simpler and hedges risks along the way. It would therefore make sense that where possible it should be used, and limit recruiting to only a specialized subset of overall positions.

For example consider an e-commerce business, they  can hire a consulting firm to build the website and manage the infrastructure. Meanwhile the project management and quality control might be the value differentiation and those parts kept in house.

## How can you screen candidates for new positions

Despite the wide range of options available to screen candidates, it is still difficult to correctly not end up with false positives and false negatives. For example a person that is intentionally trying to manipulate the personality tests, can be successful. At the same time an ideal candidate that does not feel comfortable during the screening process may come across as a terrible hire.

To overcome these limitations we need to look at the various data points that are available. For instance internal hires will have historical performance reviews, and other management references. External staff will have published works and accreditations which can be validated as authentic.

After the initial screening, the next phase should be a phone screening. Phone screens are a cheap solution to see how the person would approach various situations and real world scenarios. Assuming this goes well then advance the conversation from the glorified job post to the real details of the position. Tell the person why they do not want to work here, and weed out the people that are unlikely to be happy upfront.

Of the remaining people schedule a series of short interviews and get a general feedback from across the team. If they feel the person would be a good fit, both from technical and personal skills then advance the conversation toward hiring.

## How does emotional state influence interviewing

Based on my experience interviewing is 90% luck and 10% relevance, though it should be the other way around.  For example when I interviewed at my first professional company, they asked me a couple of basic questions and asked for college professor references.

At the next company I applied for required me to drive 2 hours in down pouring rain on bald tires. It was stressful and I thought I was going to die, so I did not arrive at the office feeling ready to interview. The interviewer used the opportunity to express their superiority and by the time it was over, it was clear neither of us were interested.

The next company was a referral and the interview a formality. Then off to corporate America, for a job that I didn't even want but they would reimburse me on a 4 day weekend. I was the right balance of cocky and confident which made me a good fit for group's culture. Still at that company decade later.

Some of the tips that I've collected over the years to improve the odds include:

1. If you're bad at interviewing, tell the new manager upfront
2. Loop in your current manager to the transition discussion upfront (they can provide references)
3. Share your performance history with the new manager (both good and bad)
4. For the bad, soften with what you learned from the situation
5. Keep in touch with former team members
6. Practice in advance the interview process
7. Meet the other team members over lunch, see if they connect on personal level
8. Consider moving to teams you've interacted with and have a reputation, versus blindingly jumping ship

## How can we plan for acquiring the ideal employer/employee

An observation I had from this video is that recruiting is a lot like buying a car. If we simply go window shopping, a good purchase might be made but it will be inefficient and waste time and effort. Alternatively we can first define the budget, characteristics, must haves and nice to haves, then strategically go shopping.

Having a purchasing plan not only allows us to quickly find a good fit, it allows us to find multiple good fits. We can then prioritize the matches and further scope down to just the right option.

To select the right option we can once again use the purchasing plan and make sure that there are no deal breakers in our selected package. This will result in both sides being more happy with the outcome.

Another key benefit to having the plan upfront is that the other side will have a more positive response to the interviewing process. Consider Bob coming in and saying "hey you're hiring? neat, what do you do?" versus Charlie asking "what are the engineering positions in department `<blah>`, which can leverage skills `<foo>` under condition `<bar>` and not `<cheese>`".

## Any final thoughts for the week

The theory of staffing, recruiting, and defining an interview process is something that everyone will experience, from various directions. However the only education than many get is based on "job fairs" and a "few tips from senior staff."

It's crazy to think that there is not an entire course dedicated to this concept, required by everyone during their sophomore year of school. Having this understanding would improve the selection process, reduce overhead, and lessen frustration from interviewer/-ee interactions.

Now that I have spent some time on the topic, we are at an advantage compared to many of our peers. The rules of the game have been explained, and we understand the rational of the scoring system; reducing black box characteristics.

From the perspective of a future manager, this week has been very useful to understanding how people are interviewed. It's not about "asking the right questions," its about knowing what qualities you are trying to purchase. Then determining what behaviors make up those qualities. Finally probing those behaviors and deriving conclusions to determine how past behavior would predict future behavior.

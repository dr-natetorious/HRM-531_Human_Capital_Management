# Discussions around Performance Management

## What are SMART Goals

Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic and Timely goals are essential to personal performance objectives. If a goal is missing some or all of these descriptors then it is difficult or impossible to know if the end result was a success.

In a lot of ways its analogous to taking the family on a vacation. If you get in the car and just head west, is the final destination the place you intended? Maybe it was, does that mean that it was successful if the path took 2 days instead of 1 hour?

For business scenarios we have the same need to have a direction, determine if its on track, and what changes are needed to hedge risk or minimize overhead. The SMARTer the goal the easier those things will be.

Thanks to the Internet and increased abilities of globalization, business also takes place at a much faster pace. This increase in process agility also requires SMART goals. "What do our customers need, can we deliver on there schedule?" and related questions are just some of the many examples of where the organizational benefits of SMART goals can be seen.

## What are the components of Performance Management Plans

Performance management plans exist to make sure that goals of the organization are being obtained in an efficient manner. To serve this need it needs the following key components:

- Clearly identified end goals
- Measurement of effectiveness
- Assessment of results relative to intent

The book describes this as being like a compass, where the business has defined a direction and the performance management is making sure the contributors are heading in the right direction.

Of these the most challenging is picking a clear goals. Simply selecting a goal such as "increase profits" would be an example of not defining clear goals. Instead we need to select something an objective such as "increase number of customers through targeted advertising toward demographic `<blah>`."

With the specific targets measuring and course correcting becomes straight forward to implement. For instance with this example we can set a target of 5% growth in customer population over the year.  

In contract with the generic goal we could end up focusing on random and unorganized aspects of "increasing profits" without any idea how sustainable the net effect was.

## What is the impact of stack ranking

At my current company we used to have forced stack rankings of scores between 1 (good) to 5 (bad). 70% of the people would get a 3 and bonus/raises were assigned per bucket.

This effectively meant that you could slack off work hard and end up with the same compensation. If you wanted to treat the job as a career, then there was value in working harder to get promoted. Once you were promoted there was an opportunity to still be a 3 but it was a larger percentage bonus.

When we looked across our nearly 80 person team, everyone was the same level. There was 2-3 senior employees and they reached that position by tenure not effort.

Because of this several of us would only work partial days, every sick days each year was collected on, and two week projects would take two months to complete. The entire situation was highly inefficient.

Though from there perspective this was fine for management. The product needed to align releases with Windows 4 year cycle, and it was considered a monopoly. Since there was no need to incentive harder work they were able to keep the majority of the compensation for their top 15% of the staff.

Since the margins were so high for that group it had very little turn over. It was not uncommon for the top tier to have 15 years experience on the project, while most 3s only stuck around for 2-4 years.

## Should there be a separation of appraisal and rewards

When an employer gives a performance review there are typically two components: appraisal and reward. Since these are both large and important topics, it is easy for one of them to high jack the conversation. This leads to the employee only getting partial benefit from even having the performance review meeting.

To address this my company updated their HR policy so that appraisal of skills are done in Feb/June. There is no mention of money or bonuses permitted during this meeting and the sole topic is only what is going well/bad. Then in August there is a third meeting to focus only on bonuses.

This seems to work well and makes the meeting more organized and stay on focus. Before this change it was easy to rat hole on "my bonus was X% so what specifically lead to that number."

Having specific examples is mentally reassuring for the employee, but in a well designed system the review should cover the annual behavior not one incident.

## How can you effectively provide a negative review

When giving a person constructive criticism, such as the case with a negative appraisal, a good approach is to use the complement sandwich. Describe an area they are doing well, then what is not going so well, and then end it with a second area that is going well.

This approach can reduce the frustration and de-motivation that the receiving employee will have from the official news.

Before receiving the official news a good manager should have prepared their staff with routine unofficial appraisals. These reduce the anxiety as there is no ambiguity or surprises. People typically prefer to know the result instead of letting their imagination run wild.

If a person's manager does not provide this information on a regular cadence, then the employee needs to drive the conversation. A good time to do this is during regular 1:1 sessions with the manager.

If a person does not even have 1:1 sessions with their manager, this should be a big red flag that the employee will need to put in extra effort to both get appraisal and ensure visibility (a.k.a. credit) for their efforts.

## How would you implement a performance review system

If I was tasked with creating a performance system, I'd start by looking at the dimensions that needed to be captured:

- Must be simple and Intuitive
  - Think bulleted lists not essays
  - No ambiguity of what is measured or company goals
- Considers business impact, value provided
  - How would the last year have been different without this person
- Evaluates efficiency and bandwidth
  - Are tasks completed correctly the first time
  - How many tasks can the person complete per day/month
  - How complex can the tasks be
- Considers negative impact to team
  - Does the person slow down progress
  - Does the team want to work with this person
  - Do they break functionality or cause customer loss

Then using this information stack rank all of the employees in the group from best to worst. Using a forced distribution the base scores of each person would be assigned. Next each employee would need to evaluated and either bumped up or decreased from the base score.

To determine the "bump" I would consider their compensation rate relative to other people around their same position in the stack. Other factors such as what results and general career trajectory can also be considered.

For the people at the bottom of the stack which are also under performing, they should be provided additional training and placed on probationary status. If they do not complete the training or improve them they should be managed out.

## What did you learn this week

This week focused on performance management and development, which is two areas of human resources that even those of us outside of HR can leverage. 

I found it interesting to learn that my experiences are not unique and performance management is topic few managers get correct. This comes from various challenges such as the inability to bluntly say, "i flat out do not see value in blah" or not aligning the performance management with the goals of the organization.

When I have staff I plan to be more direct and explicit about my performance management. To do this I will first enumerate the priorities that my department needs to accomplish. From these objectives ask my directs to come up with sub tasks and goals needed to make that happen.

Then I plan to compare what they committed to versus what they delivered. Those that met their goals timely and efficiently should receive higher rewards than those that over promised and under delivered. Though a careful balance needs to be struck that the amount promised at least justifies that persons wage.

As the current employee this same logic will be useful to help me score higher in appraisal. This will be largely due to understanding the scoring criteria thus being better at the game.

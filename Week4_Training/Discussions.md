# Themes in Training

## How does your organization approach training

My organization (fortune 50) used to have a huge budget for in person training, guest lectures, and they would run these series in small groups on a regular basis. Though as part of budget cuts they have removed this model.

Now their goal is to get the most value possible out of each training session. To do this they will have training conferences with huge auditoriums that anyone can attend. The talks are professionally recorded and then uploaded to a search able video portal (think YouTube but more corporate). We also have a library that will interoffice mail books, and they will get us licenses to on line training programs. 

Then they took the savings and converted that into tuition reimbursement. For undergrad its 5500/year and grad school 10k/year; which makes programs like this nearly free for us. Since it's "free money" some of us will take the training and in theory they have a 10k/year better employee. There is some limitations; e.g. your manager has to sign off work related, and student has to get passing grade to get paid. 

This is an effective solution as they are only paying for the training that gets used. Expensive training such as guest speakers can also be used numerous times and on demand. Both characteristics are also critically important as my company is globally distributed and many employees are not at headquarters.

### Should the cost of training be considered

Training is another line item on the budget and its cost needs to have a business justification. Consider a bank manager wanting to take a knitting course versus the same person working on their CPA certification.

Though there could still be justification, such as the manager is very stressed. The business can then way the 187$ per credit hour at the community college versus the gains of a more productive leader and determine if its worth it.

In this and many other scenarios its important to remember that the "employee learning something" is only one part of what the training program provides.

### Should employees be required to reimburse the business for training if they quit

> We also stipulated an agreement that the employee cannot leave the organization for an entire year, or they have to reimburse the organization the funds they received.

Not to "side with the enemy" but that seems fair from the business stand point. The reason training is provided to staff is so that they become better employees and thus provide more business value.

Consider the scenario of an employee working for 3 months then enrolling in a 2,000$/month educational program. This is a large cost but easy to justify as that education will be staying in house and be a resource to the entire team.

However if the person leaves after 6 months, then the company is out 12,000$ with nothing to show for it. This does not make a very good business investment. 

To reduce the investment risk many businesses, especially small/mid sized, will ask for an employment duration commitment. Then if the person is not planning on staying the hope is they will be forthright and not add the additional cost.

If the break these terms then the business can take it out of their last check, but that's about it. Taking the employee to small claims court is a waste of time and resources. Not to mention they come off looking vindictive which can hurts their image to the rest of the employees.

### Should training always be a priority for the business

I think the pendulum based on the business priorities at any given time. During the two times that learning was brought back into focus what was occurring in your company?

Most likely the business was having difficulties finding candidates with the required skill set. If they cannot buy the service, the next option is to make it in house. This is more expensive in terms of time and potential risk (e.g. no guarantee you finish the program or stay afterward).

Another common reason for the spending, saving, spending cycle; is that the business item is not properly monitored. The company needs more skilled employees so it approves lots of training expenses. After a period of time they look at the bill and start being more selective.

Their selectiveness discourages people from signing up, which decreases overall company growth. After it crosses an threshold performance management and control functions kick in and start approving more training; thus starting the cycle all over again.

To the employee the whole thing seems crazy, though as a person going through an MBA program I understand the business justification for making this standard operating procedures.

## Should training be a responsibility of the federal government

> President Barack Obama signed the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) into law on July 22, 2014. As reported on the US Department of Labor website, "WIOA is designed to help job seekers access employment, education, training, and support services to succeed in the labor market and to match employers with the skilled workers they need to compete in the global economy."

As discussed in previous weeks, globalization and advanced communication systems (e.g. Internet), have transitioned the world of services to being a buyers market. This not only applies to consumers but also to businesses as they seek out human talent services.

Because of the paradigm shift it is ever increasing that candidates have more current training, so that they can stand out as a good deal for the employer. 

These training and development programs need to come from somewhere, and that some where is typically three options: higher education (college), on the job training, and governmental/vocational schools. All three are needed as they solve different parts of the same puzzle.

After the candidates have received these educational offerings they are more hire-able, reducing burden on welfare programs. Employers are also able to get better employees which results in better and more competitive solutions. The employee will have a higher standard of live, have more disposable income to reinvest in the economy, and generally be more productive.

In such a resolution everyone is the victor and it therefore makes sense that organizations, governmental programs, and higher education should collaborate in the design of these programs.

## Is there a difference between trained and developed skills

Training and development refers to short term and long term educational objectives. The two are complementary as training tries to teach the employee how to complete a task, while development teaches the employee why.

If an organization focuses on only one piece of the puzzle, it will most likely be the training portion. This results in employees that can do their core job but will lack the maturity and breath around that core job.

For example this week my team hit a software bug in a partner teams product, which they assigned a first/second year developer to the support case. He could answer questions and explain how the system worked; however developed skills such as follow up, communication, reporting status, risk management in solution, were all missing.

After he accidentally broke our production environment, they assigned a senior engineer to the task. This person actively posted status, verified changes in test systems, and under promise/over delivered how long the resolution would take.

This real world training scenario was beneficial to me as I learned how their bug process works. It was even more beneficial as an example of how developed versus non developed employees approach the same problem.

## How can we evaluate the quality of training program

There are four-levels to the Kirkpatrick model:

- Level 4 - Results
What measurable organizational benefits resulted from the training in terms such as productivity, efficiency and sales revenue?

- Level 3 - Behavior
To what extent did participants change their behavior back in the workplace as a result of the training?

- Level 2 - Learning
To what extent did participants improve knowledge and skills and change attitudes as a result of the training?

- Level 1 - Reaction
To what extent did the participants find the training useful, challenging, well-structured, organized, and so on?

When we create a training program it is natural for us to only look at the first two levels, did people enjoy it and understand it. However the more abstract and possibly more important levels; was there behavior change and business impact is typically under represented and not measured.

For example I had to create a training series on how to use databases for my team. I bought beer and pizza which helped increase the attendance and people even liked and understood the results.

To demonstrate behavioral change and business impact, I found volunteers to apply the training to their current work. The volunteers were strategically picked so there was senior, junior and an entry level engineers. Each volunteer came from a different part of the product group instead of everyone from the same team.

They were given a 10 minutes to present their solution to the entire product group, which provided them with visibility and incentive to do it effectively. Another key benefit of doing it this way is that there was now "many recognized experts" instead of just "me the expert."

With multiple experts the business impact can be even larger, and still directly traced back to the training program I provided. Thus further increasing the business impact of my training program.

## Can you over train employees

Many employers are worried that they will over train their employee and then not retain them. This is wrongly looking at the symptom and not assessing the core problem, Why do trained employees leave in the first place?

- Their skills do not align with the job
- Their job security does not align with the job
- Their social preference does not align with the job

When an employee becomes over qualified, promote or repositioned them to a more complex part of the business. This should be seen as a new corporate asset and used accordingly.

Part of utilizing that asset is making the employee feel their talents can best be used at the current company. Since the business has just invested in training them, they can use this as evidence that they are interested in further developing the team member.

There are scenarios where the job was a stepping stone to a larger career goal. In these cases the business should outline how they are an equally good career option. The other business might be larger and have more resources, but here the member would have more control and responsibility. Other similar arguments can easily be made against any move.
